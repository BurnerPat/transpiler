# transpiler_poc
proof of concept

this is just a proof of concept

code will be moved somewhere later, considering using Lerna and adding this part to the main abaplint repo

code will be refactored later, need to solve some cyclic dependencies inside abaplint first

type information will be required, to be added later, also more work in abaplint needed for this

this currently just focuses on transpiling, not the runtime

run

`npm install`

`npm test`
